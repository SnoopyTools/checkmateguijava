# checkm8gui

checkm8gui is an application for macOS and Linux which adapts the [ipwndfu](https://github.com/axi0mx/ipwndfu/) command-line tool by [axi0mX](https://twitter.com/axi0mx/) to a graphical application.

## Estimated Release Date

checkm8gui is still in development. No public commits will be made until a working application has been completed. Once this first commit has been released, bugs will be fixed as they are reported, or found, by me. The estimated release date for checkm8gui is October 8th, 2019.

## Disclaimer

This is not a tool for the inexperienced. This tool could seriously damage your device if misused. If you don't know what you're doing, stay away from this application.
